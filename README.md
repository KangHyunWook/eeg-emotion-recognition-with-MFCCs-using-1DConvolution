# eeg-emotion-recognition-with-MFCCs-using-1DConvolution

Program description: This program applys STFT(Short-Time Fourier Transform) on the eeg signals and applys MFCC(Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient) to extract features. These MFCCs are provided for the training data labeled with one of neutral, negative, and positive.
